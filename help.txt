RUN: npm init to install package.json
RUN: node app.js

To store items, in personal list we have items[] array, and for worklist we have workItems[] array.
We have separate routes for both pages and using EJS we render and just change content on single page.

TWO routes-->>

1]  Personal list routes:
    app.get('/')
    app.post('/')
    let items = [];                   // Declare empty array for personal list to store and append list items in it


2]  Work list routes:
    app.get("/work")
    app.post("/work")
    let workItems = [];                // Declare empty array for work list

In index.html input form make "action" dynamic url.

How Page Works? :
1] Firstly it renders page of get url  requested
2] Then, you can post data to dynamic url in html Page
3] Capture data POST request data by body parser 
3] Then, Using EJS variables we append that data to empty array acc to list open like worklist or personal list
4] Finally, Redirect to get url 
Again process 1 start runs in cycle.

PARTIALS AND LAYOUTS IN EJS:
Divide whole page into header footer and then connect them all.

Why need templates?


PROBLEM:

If (today.getDay() == 0) {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "sunday.html")
} 
else if ((today.getDay() == 1)) {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "monday.html")
}
else if ((today.getDay() == 2)) {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "tuesday.html")
}

For above task you need to make so many html files.But what if you send single html file and further change embedded data in it.Like in case of creating 3 different html page of welcome, success, failure to show message. we can make single html page and change inner content according to need.
inject js variables permanently in html page whose value can be change and make it dynamic page.


EJS: EMBEDDED JAVASCRIPT Templating module  (npm i ejs)

It replace <%= key %> in html with key:value in app.js

SCRIPLET TAG  <% Control flow like if else, while loop, switch statement %>

Replace  only non html content with Scriplet tag. 
Advice to avoid writing logic of control  flow scriplet tags in html fie as it is frontend part, embedded your logic in app.js file and pass only variable values.
